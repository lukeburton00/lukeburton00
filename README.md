Hi, I'm Luke!

I'm a computer science student at Western Governors University. I really enjoy learning to code and working on exciting projects.


Right now, I'm learning...
- backend development with Ruby on Rails 
- Game engine architecture in C++
- Desktop application development in Java

Some of my more recent projects include...
- A school project utilizing Java, FXML, JDBC, and MySQL to build a desktop appointment scheduling application.
- SmartShifts, my first Rails app, which allows managers to efficiently build a roster of employees and see when they are available to work.
- A 2D C++ game engine with SDL2 and OpenGL

Outside of school and software projects, I love to spend time in the outdoors with activities like backpacking, rock climbing, and tennis!
