Hi, I'm Luke!

I'm a computer science student at Western Governers University. I really enjoy learning to code and working on exciting projects.

Right now, I'm learning...
- backend development with Ruby on Rails 
- frontend development with React.js 
- game development in Unity with C#

Some of my more recent projects include...
- SmartShifts, my first Rails app, which allows managers to efficiently build a roster of employees and see when they are available to work.
- Ping, a fun Pong clone built in a few hours in Unity featuring a basic computer opponent for singleplayer and single keyboard multiplayer.

Outside of school and software projects, I love to spend time in the outdoors with activities like backpacking, rock climbing, and tennis!
