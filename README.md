Hi, I'm Luke!

I'm a recent B.S. Computer Science graduate from Western Governors University. I really enjoy learning to code and working on exciting projects.

Right now, I'm learning...
- PERN full-stack development
- C++ Game engine systems
- Network programming in C

Outside of software projects, I love to spend time in the outdoors with activities like backpacking, rock climbing, and tennis!
