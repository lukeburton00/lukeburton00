Hi, I'm Luke!

I'm a computer science student at Western Governors University. I really enjoy learning to code and working on exciting projects.


Right now, I'm learning...
- Ruby on Rails 
- C++ Game engine systems
- Java desktop applications

Some of my more recent projects include...
- A Rails messaging app featuring mutual friendships and turbo streams for instant messaging
- A school project utilizing Java, FXML, JDBC, and MySQL to build a desktop appointment scheduling application.
- A 2D C++ game engine with SDL2 and OpenGL

Outside of school and software projects, I love to spend time in the outdoors with activities like backpacking, rock climbing, and tennis!
