Hi, I'm Luke!

I'm a recent B.S. Computer Science graduate at Western Governors University. I really enjoy learning to code and working on exciting projects.

Right now, I'm learning...
- MERN stack
- C++ Game engine systems
- Ruby on Rails

Some of my more recent projects include...
- www.monocle.social - A freelance project building an AI content helper for Instagram professionals - Ruby on Rails
- A simple 2D C++ and OpenGL game framework
- A school project utilizing Java, FXML, JDBC, and MySQL to build a desktop appointment scheduling application.

Outside of software projects, I love to spend time in the outdoors with activities like backpacking, rock climbing, and tennis!
